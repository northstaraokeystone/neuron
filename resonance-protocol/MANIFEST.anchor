# RESONANCE PROTOCOL v2.0 - MANIFEST.anchor

VERSION: 2.0.0

## PARADIGM INVERSION

OLD: Build separate neural processing system disconnected from QED/ProofPack
NEW: Extend QED/ProofPack to neurophysiology - receipts ARE neural state

## CORE INSIGHT

The brain is an entropy-fighting system. Thread retraction is mechanically
inevitable. HDC's holographic robustness is not optimization - it's physical
necessity. Federated sovereignty is not feature - it's architecture.

## MODULE MANIFEST

src/core.py          - Neural primitives, dual-hash, thermal limits
src/hdc.py           - Hyperdimensional Computing encoder (10k-bit)
src/oscillation_detector.py - SWR/Spindle/SO detection (<2ms latency)
src/phase_predictor.py      - Phase-locking prediction (pi/4 error target)
src/federated_coordinator.py - FL aggregation (raw data never transmitted)
src/stim_controller.py       - Stimulation safety (Shannon limit)
src/thread_monitor.py        - Channel quality tracking
src/entropy.py               - HDC vector entropy measurement

## RECEIPT TYPES

hdc_encoding_receipt    - HDC encoding operations
swr_detection_receipt   - Sharp-Wave Ripple detection events
fl_update_receipt       - Federated learning updates
phase_lock_receipt      - Phase prediction and locking
channel_quality_receipt - Thread/electrode quality
stimulation_receipt     - Stimulation pulses
thermal_violation_receipt - Safety limit violations

## KILLED

- Cloud-based neural processing (latency physics impossible)
- Global neural data aggregation (privacy violation)
- Fixed CNN architecture (fails on thread retraction)
- Suprathreshold stimulation (too crude)
- Single-hash verification (CLAUDEME requires dual-hash)

## CONSTANTS

HDC_DIMENSION = 10000
N1_CHANNELS = 1024
PHASE_LOCK_LATENCY_MS = 2.0
STIM_CHARGE_DENSITY_LIMIT = 30.0 uC/cm^2
THERMAL_LIMIT_DELTA_C = 1.0
CHANNEL_DROPOUT_TOLERANCE = 0.30

## GATE SEQUENCE

Gate 1: HDC_FOUNDATION (orthogonality, dropout robustness)
Gate 2: OSCILLATION_DETECTION (latency <2ms)
Gate 3: FEDERATED_INFRASTRUCTURE (zero raw data)
Gate 4: PHASE_LOCKING (error <pi/4 rad)
Gate 5: SAFETY_COMPLIANCE (Shannon limit)
Gate 6: INTEGRATION (end-to-end pipeline)

## PHYSICS VALIDATED

QED Compression: HDC holographic robustness parallels QED's 0.999 recall
ProofPack Sovereignty: FL raw-data-never-leaves parallels local receipts
AXIOM Constraints: <2ms latency is physics, not performance target

No receipt -> not real. Ship at T+24h or kill.
